When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    We would like to create a remote repository when it is likely to be shared with the team or certain number of people want to eork on that repository. So it is a good idea to use remote repository so that everyone can access it as well as we can keep track of the changes to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In the remote repository there may be several changes being pushed all the time by other people working on the repository and if git automatically pulls changes and updates the local repository my repository will keep on changing with every commit and I will not be able to work on my file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork copies a repository from one account to another. I would like to use it when a repository is on a different github account and i want to make changes to it, I will copy it to my account and make changes.
    Clone downloads a repository from a remote to your local computer. I would like to use it when a repository is on my account and i want to download on my local.
    Branch is a copy of the master branch so that we can make changes without effecting the master code. I would like to create it when a repository is local on my machine and I want to make changes without effecting the original code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
