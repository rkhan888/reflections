When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    We would like to create a remote repository when it is likely to be shared with the team or certain number of people want to eork on that 
    repository. So it is a good idea to use remote repository so that everyone can access it as well as we can keep track of the changes to the 
    repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
