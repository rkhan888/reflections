What happens when you initialize a repository?Why do you need to do it?



it creates a .git directory in the repossitory. We need to do it because without doing that it would just be a normal directory not a git repository. And we wont be able to make changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?



the files in the staging area are the files that are being changed and ready to be committed where as files in working directory are not changed. we can make logical commits by putting related files in one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?



I will keep on adding the changes to the file related to a certain logical change and keep on adding the file to the staging area until i feel that i have completed the changes related to a logical change and only then i will commit the changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?



merging two branches together adds the changes or features created in the branch to the production code which is the final application. We represent it in the diagram to give a visualization to the commit history so that one can tell where a new branch started and where it merged just by looking at the diagram.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?


Automatic merging of two branches is very useful as it will merge two versions of program into one without any problem. and it also tells us when there is a conflict in any of the file(i.e. when different changes are being made to one file by different people) so that we can go into the file and resolve the issue by hand.
